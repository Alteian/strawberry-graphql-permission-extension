class HasPermissionToInteract(BasePermissionExtension):
    """
    Extension class that checks if the user has permission to interact with the specified object(s).

    Example Usage:
        class MyModel(models.Model):
            OWNER_FIELD = BaseOwnerFieldEnum.USER.value <-- This is the field that stores the owner of the object

            @property
            def OWNER_FIELD(self):
                return self.created_by

        To use this extension, create a subclass of HasPermissionToInteract and implement the
        resolve_for_user method, calling check_obj_permissions for the relevant object(s) that
        the user intends to interact with.

    Attributes:
        DEFAULT_ERROR_MESSAGE (str): Default error message displayed when the user doesn't have permission.
        SCHEMA_DIRECTIVE_DESCRIPTION (str): Description of the schema directive.

    Methods:
        resolve_for_user(
            self,
            resolver: typing.Callable,
            user: UserType,
